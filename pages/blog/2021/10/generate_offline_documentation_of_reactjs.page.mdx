When it comes to learning a new language, framework or library, the first and
important source of help comes from the documentation provided by the official
websites. But it is often difficult to go through the complete documentation
immediately. And during development we need to refer to the documentation very
frequently.

Having an offline version of the documentation may help to find the information
faster and whenever required. Also, it helps to work offline without any
distractions from the facebook notifications.

In this post, let's build the offline documentation for reactjs.

## Getting the source code

The documentation for reactjs is available on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org)
website. The source code for this website is available as a
[github repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).

Fireup a cmd, clone this repository and cd into the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org
cd reactjs.org
```

Open the code editor of your choice. If using vscode, just enter

```bash
code .
```

## Understanding the tech stack

Once we have the source code, we can see many configuration files there. The
most important ones that quickly gives us all the information we need are

1. `gatsby-*.js` - these files tells us that [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
   is used for generating the static HTML for the website.
1. `yarn.lock` - it is using yarn as the package manager.
1. `vercel.json` - the website is hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com)

## package.json

Perhaps, `package.json` is the one file that any webdev will start looking at
when they start working on a new project. Once we open this file, we can see the
dependencies of the projects and the scripts used.

From the file we can see the following scripts.

![Scripts in package.json file](/images/2021/10/react/package.json_scripts.png)

Luckily, we have the **build** script that we require to build the static HTML.

## Commands

Now we have enough information to generate the documentation.

1. Install all the dependencies using the `yarn` package manager.

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

1. Run the build script using

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   This will generate the required static HTML, js, css and all assets in the
   **public** folder.

1. Serve the documentation generated in **public** folder

   ```sh
   cd public
   python -m http.server # simpler
   # Or if you prefer nodejs
   yarn add global serve
   serve
   ```

**Congratulations!** :clap: :bouquet: We now have reactjs documentation
available offline.
