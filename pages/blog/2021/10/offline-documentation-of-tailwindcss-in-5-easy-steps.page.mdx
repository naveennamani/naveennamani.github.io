In this post, let's build the offline documentation for **tailwindcss**, my
favorite utility first CSS framework, and my go to CSS framework for rapidly
prototyping a design.

## Getting the source code

The documentation for tailwindcss is available on
[tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com) website. We can easily find the
source code for this website on github through a simple google search. It is
hosted on github at
[https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com).

Let us first download the source code and inspect.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com
cd tailwindcss.com
```

Open the code editor of your choice. If using vscode, just enter

```bash
code .
```

## Understanding the tech stack

If we look at the files in the root directory, we can understand that

1. `next.config.js` - The website is written in nextjs
1. `tailwind.config.js` - The website is build using tailwindcss as the CSS
   framework (what else you expect?)
1. `yarn.lock` - using yarn as the package manager

For understanding the deployment process of nextjs, we can simply go to its
corresponding documentation website. You can find the information in below
links.

1. [Deployment | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)
1. [Advanced features: Static HTML Export | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export)

## package.json

Once you gain enough info on how deployment works, let's open `package.json`
file and see if we have the required scripts already present. Luckily, we have
the script **export** for generating static files. Our life has been made easier
already.

## Commands

Now we have enough information to generate the documentation.

1. Install all the dependencies using the `yarn` package manager.

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

1. Run the build script using

   ```bash
   yarn export
   ```

   This will generate the required static HTML, js, css and all assets in the
   **out** folder.

1. Serve the documentation generated in **out** folder

   ```sh
   cd out
   python -m http.server # simpler
   # Or if you prefer nodejs
   yarn global add serve
   serve
   ```

**Congratulations!** :clap: :bouquet: We now have tailwindcss documentation
available offline.

## Pro tip for vscode users

### jsconfig.json

If you have the following directory structure

```
Home
\- components
   |- A.js
   |- B.js

utils
\- utils.js
```

and want to import `utils.js` in `A.js`, you need to use relative paths as
follows

```js
import utils from "../../utils/utils.js";
```

This makes it harder to follow the file being imported, and once you have a
folder structure 3 or more levels deep, this makes it even harder to write the
required imports keeping in mind all the folders.

**jsconfig.json** to the rescue!

You can use "compilerOptions" > "paths" dictionary to define the path mappings
relative to the root of the project.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/utils/*": ["utils/*"],
      "@/home/*": ["Home/components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now instead of all those relative paths to import utils, you can simply use

```js
import utils from "@/utils/utils.js";
```

to import the utils, and to import `A.js` in any other file, we can write

```js
import A from "@/home/A.js";
```

You can see this `jsconfig.json` file being used in the `tailwindcss.com`
project. Go inspect the source code and have fun learning new things.
