[Offline-docs](https://github.com/naveennamani/offline-docs) :cloud: is a repo
with collection of scripts to build offline documentation for your favourite
frameworks/libraries. Simply search :mag_right: for your tool, copy/paste the
build commands and enjoy.

## But why? / Motivation

Learning or working on a new language often requires referring to the official
docs multiple times. With the rise of **Static Site Generation (SSG)** many
documentation sites are now open-source and can be built for offline usage. This
project aims to collect all such websites and the build commands to have a
knowledge of widely used SSG tools.

## How to use this repo

Details about each tool such as website, source code repo and build commands are
given in README page of the
[repo](https://github.com/naveennamani/offline-docs). Once you are on the repo

1. Find the framework/library/tool for which you want to build the documentation
   (you can search in the
   [Available Tools](https://github.com/naveennamani/offline-docs#available-tools)
   or with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>)
1. Open a new terminal
1. Copy paste the build commands shown for the tool
1. Open the output dir as mentioned in the last command (or) unarchive the
   .tar.gz file in your preferred location and rename the folder
1. Use any static site serving tools like
   [serve (npm package)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) or simply
   `python -m http.server`. (We recommend using serve package)

## Currently available tools

- Blockchain
  - ethereum
  - hardhat
- Build tools
  - vite
- CSS frameworks/libraries

  - vuejs v3

Many more websites are coming soon (including Mozilla Developer Network (mdn)
:wink:). So, go to the repository, create a star :star: and show your love
:heart: towards the project.

Thanks for your time!
