[vite-plugin-ssr](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/) is vite plugin which allows us
to build websites with Server Side Rendering (SSR), Client Side Rendering (CSR),
Single Page Applications (SPA) and Static Site Generation (SSG) all in one. This
plugin is like Next.js but provides more control over each page and for any of
your favorite frontend framework. Please visit the website to learn how to use
this plugin.

In this tutorial we'll learn how to setup mdx-js library for vite project for
building markdown based websites and to prerender them using vite-plugin-ssr to
generate static websites.

> The vite-plugin-ssr
> [github repo](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/tree/master/examples)
> contains example projects which you can clone and start with. For example
> [react-full example](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/tree/master/examples/react-full)
> already provides a setup for working with mdx-js library. The intention of
> this tutorial is to show how to solve some of the problems I encountered while
> using the mdx-js library and vite-plugin-ssr prerender feature.

## Project setup

First of all, we need to setup a vite + vite-plugin-ssr based project. To
scaffold a vite-plugin-ssr project simply execute

```sh
npm init vite-plugin-ssr
```

Give your project a name (I named it nn-blog) and select the frontend framework
(in this example react) you would like to use. Once the command runs simply go
to your project folder and install all dependencies.

```sh
cd nn-blog
npm install
```

Then run the dev server with `npm run dev`. Congratulations, you've just setup a
vite + vite-plugin-ssr based project. The setup comes initialized with a git
repo, so you can start modifying the code around. And you'll notice how
blazingly fast the vite dev server is.

Once you understand the
[filesystem routing](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/filesystem-routing) concepts of
vite-plugin-ssr, create some pages and experiment. When you're ready let's start
with adding mdx-js.

## Adding mdx-js to vite project

mdx-js is a library which converts markdown content to jsx compatible content
that you can then use with your jsx based libraries such as react, preact, vue.

> MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components,
> such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. vite
> uses rollup under the hood to build bundles for production. So for installing
> mdx-js to a vite project, we should use `@mdx-js/rollup` and for handling
> custom MDX components we can use `@mdx-js/react` for react based projects.

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/rollup @mdx-js/react
```

Once the libraries are installed, add mdx-js to vite plugins in `vite.config.js`
file and config the mdx plugin to use @mdx-js/react as an proiderImportSource.

```diff
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import ssr from 'vite-plugin-ssr/plugin'
+import mdx from "@mdx-js/rollup"

export default {
- plugins: [react(), ssr()]
+ plugins: [react(), mdx({
+   providerImportSource: "@mdx-js/react"
+ }), ssr()],
}
```

## Solving problem 1 - require() of ES Module is not supported

Now after updating the `vite.config.js` if we try to run `npm run dev` we'll be
given this confusing error

```
failed to load config from /workspace/example/nn-blog/vite.config.js
/workspace/example/nn-blog/vite.config.js:61509
undefined
            ^

Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /workspace/example/nn-blog/node_modules/@mdx-js/rollup/index.js from /workspace/example/nn-blog/vite.config.js not supported.
```

This problems occurs in the following order.

- `npm run dev` runs `node ./server/index.js` file which is a commonjs file
- The script creates vite dev server using `vite.createServer`
- The vite dev server converts `vite.config.js` to CJS module first and then
  loads the config from this file.
- As CJS module tries to `require("@mdx-js/rollup")` plugin which is a ESM only
  module the error will be generated.

To solve this problem, we should inform vite to skip building config file to
CJS. This can be achieved by adding

```diff
+ "type": "module",
}
```

to `package.json` file.

## Solving problem 2 - require() is not defined in ES module scope

Once we inform node to enable ES modules, we cannot use `require` syntax in
`.js` files. This is exactly what you'll get when you run `npm run dev`

```
file:///workspace/example/nn-blog/server/index.js:1
const express = require('express')
                ^

ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/workspace/example/nn-blog/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
```

Luckily, the error itself gave us a solution. But you need to first stop
scratching your head and learn to read those lines in to identify the solution.
If you look carefully what we need is just to rename our `index.js` file to
`index.cjs` and :bomb:

## Solving problem 3 - Cannot find module

```
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:936
  throw err;
  ^

Error: Cannot find module '/workspace/example/nn-blog/server'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:933:15)
    at Function.Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:778:27)
    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:81:12)
    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:17:47 {
  code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
  requireStack: []
}
```

Wait, where is our file gone? Node says it can't find it, but it's there right
in the server folder.

May be if you're patient enough or highly talented nerd enough, you'll
understand that node is trying to load `server` module and not
`server/index.js`. The `/index.js` file comes into picture as part of the
[CJS module loading sequence of node](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v13.x/api/modules.html).
So, we need to add a `package.json` file with the following value

```json
{
  "main": "index.cjs"
}
```

And :sparkles: congratulations, you are now ready to go.

## Adding a markdown page

Now go to pages directory and any markdown content with `.md` or `.mdx`
extention. For example, for creating a `/naveennamani` root, add
`pages/naveennamani.page.mdx` or `pages/naveennamani/index.page.mdx` or
`pages/index/naveennamani.page.mdx` file. (I prefer the last filename for this
example).

Once you create the file add any markdown content, hit
`localhost:3000/naveennamani` url to see your markdown content getting converted
into html. For using react components inside your mdx files simply import them
and use.

```md
# Hello world

import { Counter } from "./Counter";

<Counter />
```

This will show a heading with an interactive counter that is also shown on home
page.

## Prerendering and inventing new problems

When you stop the dev server and want to build your awesome website as a static
content, you can use vite-plugin-ssr prerender feature. Just add the following
script to `package.json`

```
"scripts": {
   ...
   "prerender": "npm run build && vite-plugin-ssr prerender"
}
```

Now when you run `npm run prerender`, you'll see that `dist\client` and
`dist\server` folders are created and build files are populated there. But
prerendering is failing with

```
/workspace/example/nn-blog/dist/server/assets/naveennamani.page.04918628.js:4
var react = require("@mdx-js/react");
            ^

Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /workspace/example/nn-blog/node_modules/@mdx-js/react/index.js from /workspace/example/nn-blog/dist/server/assets/naveennamani.page.04918628.js not supported.
```

Isn't that the same problem we solved earlier? Yes. But why again? :cry: This
time the problem is created in the following order.

- When you run `npm run build` it runs `vite build` and `vite build --ssr` with
  the first command building assets for `dist\client` and second command for
  `dist\server`.
- While `dist\client` assets are all `esm` modules, `dist\client` build output
  are `cjs` modules.
- So, again `@mdx-js/react` which is a ESM only module is failed to import
  through `require`.

This time, we can generate ES modules instead of CJS modules by configuring
build options in `vite.config.js` as follows

```diff
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
  import ssr from 'vite-plugin-ssr/plugin'
  import mdx from "@mdx-js/rollup"
+ import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

+ export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react(), mdx({
      providerImportSource: "@mdx-js/react"
    }), ssr()],
+   build: {
+     rollupOptions: {
+       output: {
+         format: "es"
+       }
+     }
+   }
+ })

```

When you run `npm run prerender` again, you can see that `dist\server` folder
contains files which are ES modules. But you still get this complicated error.

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/workspace/example/nn-blog/node_modules/react/jsx-runtime' imported from /workspace/example/nn-blog/dist/server/assets/index.page.0262694b.js
Did you mean to import react/jsx-runtime.js?
```

## Writing a vite plugin to solve our problems

At first sight, the error seems like a spelling mistake. But if you google,
there is a
[long list of comments](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20235) in the
official react repo (issue #20235). The problem can be simply solved by adding
.js extension to the import, but how to do that automatically?

Let's write a vite plugin to do that for us. Writing a vite plugin is very
simple if you follow the [Vite plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin).

This is what I come with.

```js
export default function fix_ssr_esm_modules(replacements) {
  function transform(code, id, ssr) {
    if (ssr)
      // ssr is true when `vite build --ssr` is run
      return replacements.reduce((prevCode, { find, replacement }) => {
        return prevCode.replaceAll(find, replacement);
      }, code);
  }

  return {
    // configuration of our plugin used by vite
    name: "vite-plugin-fix-ssr-esm-modules",
    apply: "build", // execute only for build tasks
    enforce: "post", // execute after build finished
    transform: transform // transformation function that returns transformed code
  };
}
```

Now place the code in fix_ssr_esm_modules.js file and then import and use this
plugin in `vite.config.js` file as follows.

```diff
+ import fix_ssr_esm_modules from "./fix_ssr_esm_imports.js";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    mdx({
      providerImportSource: "@mdx-js/react",
    }),
    ssr(),
+   fix_ssr_esm_modules([
+     { find: "react/jsx-runtime", replacement: "react/jsx-runtime.js" },
+     { find: "react-dom/server", replacement: "react-dom/server.js" },
+   ]),
  ],
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        format: "es",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The plugin transforms the build files and replaces the import as given as
options to the plugin.

Now you can run `npm run prerender` and serve the files in `dist\client`
statically using `npx serve`. Congratulations :star2:, you just built a static
site using vite-plugin-ssr.

## Final touch

The final version of the source code of the project is available in github
[naveennamani/vite-ssr-mdx](https://github.com/naveennamani/vite-ssr-mdx).

Sorry for the long post, if you come here after all, here is a potato for you.
